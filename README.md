## Work Experience
**Data Developer Intern @ Country Financial (_May 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Contributed to the parameterization of technical debt by updating and testing legacy internal projects, improving code
maintainability and performance.
- Assisted in table ingestion using established frameworks, executing comprehensive Unit Testing (UT), System Integration
Testing (SIT), and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure data integrity and reliability.
- Developed a sample data generation script, enhancing project efficiency by automating the creation of test data for
development and testing phases.

**Test Engineer Intern @ Thermofisher Scientific (_September 2022 - March 2023_)**
- Engineered an end-to-end Open-CV based automation solution for validating charts on the TSX series (Ultra-Low
Temperature freezers).
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop automation scripts using Pyserial for RS232 serial communication.
- Authored a whitepaper delving into the strategic implementation of automation testing within the cold storage domain,
encompassing contemporary methodologies and future growth trajectories

**Intern @ National Institute of Wind Energy (_June 2022 - July 2022_)**
- Evaluated the applicability of machine learning approaches compared to traditional kriging methods for bias correction
for the State of Karnataka.
- Implemented kriging methods utilizing pykridge and conducted a comprehensive comparison with the identification of a
best performing Random Forest Classifier model with an R-squared value of 0.76

**Machine Learning Intern @ Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (_June 2022 - July 2022_)**
- Developed machine learning models using scikit-learn to predict wind speeds at hub heights across multiple locations,
leveraging lidar data for training and mast data for testing.
- Created visually compelling data visualizations using seaborn and windrose libraries to effectively communicate key
insights


## Projects
**Machine learning-based system for the automatic detection of RAPD and Cataract (_June 2022 - June 2023_)**
• Created a comprehensive end-to-end system spanning from image acquisition to precise pupil identification and disease
classification
• Employed a custom-trained pupil detection Mask-R-CNN model, achieving a mean average precision of 90.66 for accurate
pupil localization and utilized a Random Forest classifier for eye disorder classification, surpassing other base models
with an accuracy rate of 94.7 percent

## Achievements
- Secured 2nd place in the 2024 AgTech Research Park Hackathon, competing in the Bayer track.
- Ranked 5th place out of 300 participants in the 2024 UIUC Statistics Datathon.
- Placed 3rd in the Country Financial Annual Intern Case Study Competition and won the ”Solving Problems Creatively” track in the 2024 Internal Hackathon.
